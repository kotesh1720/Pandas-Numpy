# "Data Manipulation and Analysis with Pandas & NumPy in Python"

## Description:

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the power of Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis in Python. In this repository, you'll find Python scripts (data_manipulation_pandas.py and numerical_analysis_numpy.py) that demonstrate various features of both libraries.

## Features:

### Pandas Script:

Data Loading: Learn to load and inspect datasets using Pandas DataFrames.
Data Cleaning: Explore techniques for handling missing data and outliers.
Data Transformation: Understand how to reshape and transform data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform basic EDA using Pandas functions.

### NumPy Script:

Numerical Operations: Learn basic and advanced numerical operations with NumPy.
Array Manipulation: Explore array creation, slicing, and manipulation.
Linear Algebra: Dive into NumPy's capabilities for linear algebra operations.
Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical analysis on numerical data.
## Requirements:

Python 3.x
Pandas library (pip install pandas)
NumPy library (pip install numpy)

## Usage:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/pandas-numpy-analysis.git

### Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Explore the scripts:

python data_manipulation_pandas.py
and

python numerical_analysis_numpy.py

Feel free to explore, modify, and use these scripts as a foundation for your own data manipulation and analysis projects. If you find it helpful, don't forget to ⭐️ the repository!
